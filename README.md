# Heart-Disease-Prediction-System-using-Logistic-Regression
A Heart Disease Prediction System built on machine learning 


## Principle 

This prediction system is based on ECG data on heart diseases of patients

#### What is ECG ??

An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a quick test that can be used to examine the electrical activity and rhythm of your heart.
The electrical signals that your heart beats out each time it beats are picked up by sensors that are affixed to your skin.
A machine records these signals, and a doctor examines them to see whether they are odd.

### Workflow of model

  - Data collection 
  - Train-Test split
  - Model Training
  - Model Evaluation
  - Predicting Results
